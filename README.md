<h1> Extension To <a href= "https://github.com/PreetPatel/RobotAssignment">RobotAssignment</a> </h1>
This is an extension to the Robot Assignment repo. It uses the different types of robots created in that repo to create a graphical application which uses JSwing and multiple design patterns. RobotAssignmentGUI is a model/view application that presents three views of a shared model. Such applications are commonplace and introduce the need for views to be mutually consistent and synchronised with a model whose state changes at run-time.

<h2> Usage </h2>
With this GUI, you can add as many robots and customise their characteristics. Robots with custom images are able to be loaded as well and properties such as speed and size can be set individually.
